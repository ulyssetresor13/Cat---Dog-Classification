A small challenge to classify images of dogs and cats. Using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)
We used MobileNet in classifying the images of dogs and cats
